# gasium.exe
a safe GDI proyect
but, it can be used as a prank
t.me/LienageOSrelease has poles at the start
they said i should use scratch.mit.edu
from there, I evolved 
and now, I am coding in python
I remembered it
I changed
I did it
Gasium.exe is an insparation from those poles
there was C++ also, 
but I can't code on C++ so, hope you enjoy :)
